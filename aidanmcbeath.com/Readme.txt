This is a portfolio website based on template by BootstrapMade (details at bottom of file).
I am using NGINX as the web server component hosted on a Linode Ubuntu server.
A webhook has been configured to notify the server of any commits to the main branch.
Upon receiving notification a PHP script pulls the latest commit directly into production.

The website will feature "About Me", "Experience", "Projects" and "Blog" sections.

Development should be complete by March 2024 but progress is available to view now at "aidanmcbeath.com".
